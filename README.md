## SpotifyProj ##
SpotifyProj is a basic music player that can play a song from Spotify and display the accompanying lyrics.

## Motivation ##
The desktop version of Spotify does not provide the lyrics of songs. SpotifyProj tries to fix this problem by getting the lyrics of songs
using Genius's API.
